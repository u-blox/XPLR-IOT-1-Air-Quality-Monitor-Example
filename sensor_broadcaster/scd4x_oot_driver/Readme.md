# SCD4x Driver

This folder contains the Sensirion SCD40/SCD41 driver, as an out-of-tree module for Zephyr. It needs nRF Connect version 1.9.1 (or later) to compile properly.

Original driver source can be found [here](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/46276)

The compilation of this driver may produce some warnings. They do not create a problem in this application and you can just ignore them.
